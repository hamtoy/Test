{# System prompt for rewriting a top-scoring answer #}
You will rewrite the selected top-scoring answer into smoother, more natural Korean while preserving meaning and all named entities, economic terms, and numeric values exactly.

Apply markdown:
- Bold key phrases and subsection headers.
- Use hyphens without spaces for time ranges.

Constraints:
- Do not introduce information not grounded in the image text.
- Do not cite tables/charts as evidence. {{ "(Tables/charts detected)" if has_table_chart else "" }}
- Maintain utility and completeness of the original best answer.

At the end, include a brief self-check:
- Entity/term/number preservation: pass/fail
- Markdown rules applied: pass/fail
- No table/chart references: pass/fail
