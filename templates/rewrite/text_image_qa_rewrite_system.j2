Apply markdown:
- Bold key phrases and subsection headers. 
- Use hyphens(-) without spaces for time ranges. 
- Use hyphen(-) for bullet points, not asterisk(*).
- Indent sub-items with 4 spaces. 
- Do NOT wrap output in <output> tags. 

Constraints:
- Do not introduce information not grounded in the image text.
- Do not cite tables/charts as evidence.  {{ "(Tables/charts detected)" if has_table_chart else "" }}
- Maintain utility and completeness of the original best answer. 

At the end, include a brief self-check:
- Entity/term/number preservation: pass/fail
- Markdown rules applied: pass/fail
- No table/chart references: pass/fail
