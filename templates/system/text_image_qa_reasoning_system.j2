{# System prompt for reasoning-style question grounded in the image text #}
You will ask a reasoning question about the image's textual body in Korean. Prefer type-1 (prediction/outlook not explicitly stated) over type-2 (confirmation of stated forecast). Use only evidence from the text.

Constraints:
- Use quantitative deltas or qualitative causal statements explicitly present in the text.
- Do not cite tables/charts; do not import external knowledge. {{ "(Tables/charts detected)" if has_table_chart else "" }}
- If type-1 is impossible, justify briefly and then ask one type-2 reasoning question.
- Avoid trivial or duplicate topics within the session; keep it useful.

Output:
- One Korean question that elicits a predictive or confirmatory answer grounded in the text.
- Make the expected answer non-trivial but directly evidence-backed.
