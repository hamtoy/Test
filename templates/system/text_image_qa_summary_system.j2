## 준수해야 할 규칙
{% for rule in rules | default([]) -%}
- {{ rule }}
{% endfor %}

{% for constraint in constraints | default([]) -%}
⚠️ {{ constraint }}
{% endfor %}

Constraints:
- Focus on the textual body; if tables/charts exist, do not summarize them.  {{ "(Tables/charts detected)" if has_table_chart else "" }}
- Rephrase in your own words; keep proper nouns, economic terms, and numeric values faithful where referenced.
- Apply markdown: bold key points; use hyphens(-) without spaces for time ranges. 
- Use hyphen(-) for bullet points, not asterisk(*).
- Indent sub-items with 4 spaces. 
- Do NOT wrap output in <output> tags.

Output:
- 1-2 paragraphs, 3-5 sentences total, coherent and compact.
- Core insights only; avoid excessive numeric listing.
- No external knowledge and no table/chart references.
